    //Adapter Pattern
    // Adapter pattern makes incompatible classes work together
    // Whenever two classes are not compatible due to incompatible interfaces, so we use adapter pattern
    // Adapter pattern solves this incompatibility by inheritance or object composition

    // Class Adapter vs. Object Adapter
    // Class Adapter uses inheritance to solve incompatibility problems
    // Object Adapter uses object composition to solve incompatitibilty problems

    // Where to use Adapter Pattern
    // Whenever you want to use incompatible classes
    // When you want to create reusable class
    // When you want to make a pluggable kit
    // Whenever you want to create libraries to be used by others

    // Advantages of Adapter Pattern
    // Makes incompatible classes work together

    // Summary
    // We understood what is the Adapter Pattern
    // We saw use cases of Adapter Pattern
    // We also saw how to implement and use Adapter pattern in Java Code
    // At the end, we also discussed the benefits of Adapter pattern
